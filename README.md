Introduction

Globally, neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), such as Alzheimer's disease, significantly impact the aging population, presenting immense challenges for individuals, caregivers, and healthcare systems. Traditional caregiving methods often fall short of providing continuous and personalized care. This project addresses the critical need for innovative solutions to monitor and improve the quality of life for dementia patients.

Our proposed system leverages machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to tackle the varying severity levels of NCDs. By integrating sensors, microcontrollers, and MQTT communication protocols, we aim to provide caregivers with real-time insights and enable data-driven, personalized interventions.

Features

Continuous Monitoring: Real-time tracking of vital parameters and activity levels using IoT sensors.
Data-Driven Interventions: Machine learning models analyze collected data to provide timely alerts and insights.
Remote Accessibility: Caregivers can monitor patients and manage interventions through remote control capabilities.
Personalized Care: Tailored care plans based on individual needs and conditions.

Technologies Used

Internet of Things (IoT): For real-time monitoring using sensors and microcontrollers.

Machine Learning: To analyze data and predict patient needs.

MQTT Protocol: For efficient and secure communication between devices.
